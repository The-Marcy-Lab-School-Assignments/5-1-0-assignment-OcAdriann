# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance properties are created within the contructor function and instance methods are created within the class but doesn't use the `static` keyword. Both class properties and methods belong to the class itself and are both created using the `static` keyword. Instance properties/methods are used by calling them on the new class that the user created where as class properties/methods are called on the class itself and returns the general information of the class.
