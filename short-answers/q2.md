# Question

Provide an example a pair of classes that would create a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship.

# Answer
An example would be Teacher and student
```js
class Student {
    constructor(name, age, gender) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.gender = gender;
    }
}

class Teacher {
    #students = [];

    static #allTeachers = [];
    constructor(name, subject) {
        this.name = name;
        this.subject = subject;

        Teacher.#allTeachers.push(this);
    }

    addStudent(name, age, gender) {
        const addedStudent = new Student(name, age, gender);
        this.#students.push(addedStudent);
        return addedStudent;
    }
    listOfStudents() {
        return [...this.#students]
    }
    removeStudent(name) {
        this.#students.splice(this.#students.findIndex((student) => student.name === name), 1)
    }
    static teachers() {
        return [...Teacher.#allTeachers]
    }
}
```
The teacher class can have many students and the student class clongs to a teacher.
